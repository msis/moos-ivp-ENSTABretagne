In order to make the cameras work properly, be sure that both cameras are powered and plugged in your computer.

First remove the kernel module, wrongly started by your system, with the follow command:

    $ sudo rmmod em28xx

After that, re-enable the kernel module with the correct card information. 

    $ sudo modprobe em28xx card=67,67

This command should take 1 or 2 seconds. If don't, you did something wrong. \o/
